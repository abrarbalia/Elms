## 1. Project Brief
### Introduction / Purpose
The Education Leave Management System (ELMS) is designed to replace traditional paper-based leave applications with a digital, real-time platform. It centralizes the lifecycle of leave requests — from application and HOD approval to administrative record-keeping — while ensuring data availability through offline synchronization.

### Primary Purposes
- Provide **Admin** with a control panel to manage staff directories, leave policies, and institutional reports.
- Empower **HODs** to review and approve leave requests for their respective departments instantly.
- Give **Staff** a streamlined portal to apply for leave, track status, and manage their personal leave balance.
- Deliver **Offline Resilience** through local data persistence and automatic background sync.

### Goals & Objectives
1. **Centralized Repository**: All employee and leave data stored in a single MongoDB backend.
2. **Role-Based Workflows**: Distinct access paths for Admin, HOD, and Staff.
3. **Automated Validation**: Systematic checking of leave balances before application submission.
4. **Real-Time Sync**: Seamless transition between offline entry and online server updates.
5. **Exportable Intelligence**: Generation of professional leave reports via PDF and Excel formats.
